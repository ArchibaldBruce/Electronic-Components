Because they convert alternating current (AC) into pulsing direct current (DC), diodes are often referred to as rectifiers. [Diodes](https://www.ersaelectronics.com/c/diodes) are rated based on voltage, type, and current carrying capacity. An anode (positive lead) and a cathode (negative lead) determine the polarity of a diode. The majority of diodes only permit current to flow when the anode receives a positive voltage.
